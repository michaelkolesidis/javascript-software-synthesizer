# Changelog
Please refer to the project's [Changelog](https://github.com/michaelkolesidis/javascript-software-synthesizer/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md) document.



# Technologies Used
* [Tone.js](https://github.com/Tonejs/Tone.js/)
<br>One  could say that Tone.js is the "soul" of our project. It provides us with the synthesizers we use to generate sounds, as well as their various properties that can be tweaked and adjusted.
* [NexusUI](https://github.com/nexus-js/ui)
<br>NexusUI provides us with the UI components that are connected to the synthesizers and make parameters adjusting easy and playful.
* [WEBMIDI.js](https://github.com/djipco/webmidi)
<br>WEBMIDI.js makes Web MIDI API easy to implement. It allows users to connect their MIDI keyboards and play the synthesizer the way it is meant to be played. Because, who likes playing music with a mouse?

# Roadmap
Some of the ideas are full modular design, full compatibility with MIDI controllers, implementation of all Tone.js features, and in the (very) distant future even our own synth engines along with Tone.js.
