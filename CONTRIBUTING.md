# Contributing

First off, **thank you** for considering to contribute to this project. We aim to build an 
inclusive community around the JSS-01 project. You should know that there 
are many ways to contribute. You can write tutorials or blog posts, improve the documentation, 
submit bug reports or feature requests and write actual source code. All of these are very 
worthwhile contributions.

More detailed guidelines regarding ways to contribute will follow soon.
